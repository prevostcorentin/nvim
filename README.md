# Jazzy NeoVim — Go-powered, light as air

Welcome to my NeoVim playground:  
minimal, magical, and tuned for Go wizardry.  

No bloat here — just crisp config and jazzy flair.  
Debugging, editing, exploring — all with a smile.  

## Features
- Slick Go development setup  
- Lazy-loaded debugging with `nvim-dap`  
- Netrw tweaks for smooth file surfing  
- Custom Neovide initialization, headless-friendly  
- Poetic mappings that sing  

## Getting Started

Drop this as your `~/.config/nvim` and ride the lightning.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prevostcorentin/nvim
```
